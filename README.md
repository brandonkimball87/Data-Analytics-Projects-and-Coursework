# Data-Analytics-Projects-and-Coursework

I am currently in the final semester of my Masters of Analytics program at The University of Alabama Huntsville.
I have two undergraduate degrees (BS in Biology and BA in Psychology) from The University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa

Most of my work so far is in R and Python, with additional work in SQL.
