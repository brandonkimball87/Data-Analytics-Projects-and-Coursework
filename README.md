# Data Analytics Portfilio

## About

Hi, my name is Brandon Kimball. I am currently in the final semester of the Masters of Science in Analytics program at The University of Alabama Huntsville (May 2023 graduation).
I have two undergraduate degrees (BS in Biology and BA in Psychology) from The University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa.

The majority of my work is in R and Python, in addition to SQL. The major focus of my projects and course work
involves regression and classificaion. Specific methods include linear regression, KNN, KMeans, Decision Trees, 
Random Forest, and Na√Øve Bayes. Techniques include feature selection, model correction, imbalanced classification, 
and model assesment.
