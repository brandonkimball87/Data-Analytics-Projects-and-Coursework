# Data-Analytics-Projects-and-Coursework

Hi, I'm Brandon Kimball. I am currently in the final semester of the Masters of Science in Analytics program at The University of Alabama Huntsville.
I have two undergraduate degrees (BS in Biology and BA in Psychology) from The University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa.

Most of my work so far is in R and Python, with additional work in SQL. The major focus of projects and course work
involves regression and classificaion. Specific methods include linear regression, KNN, KMeans, Decision Trees, 
Random Forest, and Na√Øve Bayes. Techniques include feature selection, model correction, imbalanced classification, 
and model assesment.
