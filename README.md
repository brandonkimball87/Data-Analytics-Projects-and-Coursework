# Data-Analytics-Projects-and-Coursework

I am currently in the final semester of my Masters of Science in Analytics at The University of Alabama Huntsville.
I have two undergraduate degrees (BS in Biology and BA in Psychology) from The University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa

Most of my work so far is in R and Python, with additional work in SQL. The major focus of my projects and course work
involves regression and classificaion. Specific methods include linear regression, KNN, KMeans, Decision Trees, 
Random Forest. Techniques include feature selection, model correction, imbalanced classification, and model assesment.
